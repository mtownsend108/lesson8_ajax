### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. APIs are becoming a crucial part of the Web and Web Development.
2. AJAX is an acronym for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML and this technology will allow us to load data from the server without a browser page refresh. AJAX is the art of exchanging data with a server, and updates part of the web page without reloading the whole page.
3. Applications using AJAX are considered data driven as opposed to page driven. jQuery provides a rich set of AJAX methods to develop next generation web applications. Web services and APIs use JSON format to provide public data.  A lot of services we use every day have JSON.
